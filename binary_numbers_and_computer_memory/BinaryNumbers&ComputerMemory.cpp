// binary numbers and memory source
// memory comes in bytes and bits
// a byte is the smallest unit of memory that can store data, usually representing one character or eight bits.
// a bit is the smallest unit of data, representing a binary value of either 0 or 1.
// 372: 2 (2 x 1), 7 (7 x 10), 3 (3 x 100) = 300 + 70 + 2 = 372
// 1011: 1 (1 x 1), 1 (1 x 2), 0 (0 x (2 x 2)) or (0 x 4), 1 (1 x (2 x 2 x 2)) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
