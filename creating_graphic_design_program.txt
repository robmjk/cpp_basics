What we need to obtain to create a graphic design program:

Libraries
Pre-processor
Compilation (compiles a bunch of .o files)
Link (combines all of the .o files with any libraries into an executable) e.g. .exe

Static libraries (files that contain c++ code) (files that are actually compiled in your program)
Dynamic libraries (your program finds the relevant code at run time)

// windows and linux static library suffixes
Static: Windows - XYZ.lib / UNIX/Linux/Mac - libXYZ.a

// windows and linux dynamic library suffixes
Dynamic: Windows - XYZ.dll / UNIX/Linux/Mac - libXYZ.so
Mac: XYZ.dylib
