unsigned values:

3-bit system:

// how to calculate the maximum unsigned value for any particular type if you know how many bits it uses 
111 = 7 = (2 to the power of 3) - 1 = (2x2x2) - 1 = 7
(1 + 1x2 + 1x4) - (4+2+1) = 7 

// max value you can store in a byte e.g. unsigned char
8-bit system:
11111111 = (2 to the power of 8) - 1 = 255
